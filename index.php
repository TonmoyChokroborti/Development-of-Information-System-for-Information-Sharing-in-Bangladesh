          <h2>About Bangladesh</h2>
          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>Bangladesh has made impressive gains in key human development indicators in recent years. According to the 2018 UNDP Human Development Index Statistical Update, Bangladesh ranks 136th among 189 countries with an HDI score of 0.608, placing it among countries considered to have achieved medium human development. 8 million people have moved out of poverty since 2010. The country is also on track to reach the first Sustainable Development Goal of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.

But even as Bangladesh has taken these considerable steps towards poverty alleviation, many challenges remain. As of 2016, almost a quarter of the population (24.3%) still live in poverty. The constant threat of shocks – natural, political, or economic - the uncertain impact of globalization, and an increasingly competitive international trade environment impede higher growth rates. In addition, structural changes in rural Bangladesh have spurred rapid economic migration. This exacerbates urban poverty, creates a lack of reliable work and leads to congestion and limited shelter in urban areas. The rate of reduction in urban poverty has decreased in the last few years, only decreasing by 2.4 percentage points (from 21.3% to 18.9%). Bangladesh thus faces considerable challenges to sustain and build on the achievements of the last decade, and to remain on track to meet its targets under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p>
<br><br>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>Civilization in the Bengal delta dates back more than 4,300 years. The borders of present-day Bangladesh were established during the British partition of Bengal and India in 1947, when the region became East Pakistan, part of the newly formed state of Pakistan. It was separated from West Pakistan by 1,600 km (994 mi) of Indian territory. Due to a desire for political, economic and linguistic self-determination, popular agitation and civil disobedience grew against the Pakistani state. This culminated in the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971.

The People’s Republic of Bangladesh was founded as a constitutional, secular, democratic, multiparty, parliamentary republic. After independence, Bangladesh went through periods of poverty and famine, as well as political turmoil and military coups. The restoration of democracy in 1991 has been followed by considerable advances in economic, political, and social development.

Bangladesh straddles the fertile Ganges-Brahmaputra delta, and has a cultural heritage that is proudly intertwined with the broader civilizational history of the Indian subcontinent. It is a pluralistic nation of considerable religious and ethnic diversity. Bangladesh is the world's eighth most populous country and is also one of the most densely populated. The elected parliament in Bangladesh’ parliamentary electoral system is called the Jatiyo Sangsad. Bangladesh is a founding member of SAARC, the Developing 8 Countries, the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) and the Bangladesh–China–India–Myanmar Forum for Regional Cooperation (BCIM). It is also a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and the Non-Aligned Movement. Bangladesh is also the world's largest contributor to United Nations peacekeeping missions.</p>
<br><br>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>Bangladesh is undergoing substantial economic and social change, and this will intensify in the coming decades. Fundamental forces are at play, involving rapid industrialization, structural change in the economy, and substantial rural-urban migration. These processes bring a host of developmental pressures, and a range of potential inequities. In 2018, Bangladesh met the three UN criteria for LDC graduation, pending two triennial reviews in 2021 and 2024. If the country is successful, it will have to face the challenges of potentially losing preferential market access and other preferential trade concessions. Bangladesh has a centralized governance regime and a complex geography. This poses considerable challenges with regards to rapid urbanization and transboundary issues such as water security. It is vital these inequalities are addressed if poverty is to be further reduced, and a host of future problems associated with social exclusion avoided.

Environmental pressures, exacerbated by climate change, remain significant and could easily worsen if remedial actions are not taken at the local and global level. While the population is expected to stabilize at around 200 million, growing wealth and migration will place further strain on ecosystems and the living environment.

Providing better social services, especially in health and education, is also key to Bangladesh’s continuing ability to meet core welfare objectives. While the country did well in meeting its headline MDG obligations, the quality and durability of some outcomes remains inadequate in the current SDG era. Major service delivery concerns must be addressed by more effectively improving the quality of governance in Bangladesh. As inequalities get more profound and complex, there is a need to look beyond aggregate data to see whether disadvantaged groups get access to the services they need, as well as how performance varies geographically.</p><br><br>
<h3>Successes</h3>
<p>Bangladesh’s economic model has been consistently mindful of the poor and the disadvantaged. Indicators of extreme poverty demonstrate that poverty has fallen from around 50 per cent of the population in 2000, to around 24 per cent in 2016. Broad improvements in social welfare have been secured, and social safety net coverage has improved drastically. This is rooted largely in Bangladesh’s abundant supply of inexpensive labour, and in successful government policies that promote macroeconomic stability and growth. With the global economic recovery, favorable demographics and improving investor confidence, GDP growth has accelerated above 8% in FY2019, with an average of over 6.3% in the last decade.

Bangladesh retains a deep commitment to social solidarity and to a progressive development agenda. The country was one of the most successful development achievers in the MDG era and continues to do well in terms of the SDGs, including being on target to have zero extreme poverty by 2030. The Government has also been successful in identifying issues and using resources efficiently to solve them. This is most clear in relation to maternal mortality, where Bangladesh successfully overcame a significant challenge, and, as of 2015, has brought this figure down to 176 per 100,000 births. This bodes well for future interventions to capitalize on the current successes in the development regime, to further improve access to healthcare and schooling. Investment is another key area for Bangladesh, and the government’s efforts in terms of setting up 100 Special Economic Zones (SEZs) throughout the country, as well as the recent efforts to operationalise One Stop Shop (OSS) for the investors.

Ongoing government programs have targeted disaster preparedness and recovery, with great success. Bangladesh’s vulnerability to disasters is significant, but the country’s track record has been exceptional at improving human security and saving lives. While extreme climatic events still tragically result in some deaths, numbers have fallen drastically. This provides a sound foundation for addressing other pressing questions of environmental sustainability.</p>

              <p>Bangladesh exports goods worth nearly $40bn and imports goods worth nearly $60bn majority of which carried through seaways. Presently, the country’s two seaports– Chittagong and Mongla—have up to 9.5-metre draft where vessels holding up to 2,000 teu containers can anchor. Bangladesh planned to develop its first deep-sea port as part of a publicprivate partnership with Japan. Matarbari deep seaport will have a 16-metre water draft and will be able to accommodate 8,000 teu post-Panamax vessels, lessening Bangladesh’s dependence on the feeder vessels to ferry export-import goods from the hub ports in Singapore, Colombo and Port Klang. Matarbari deep sea port will be made functional by 2025.</p>

              <p>The construction work of Payra Deep Sea Port has been going rapidly since 2016. Payra will have rail, road, and waterway links with the capital of Dhaka, around which most of the country’s garment industry is based and which by extension is the primary destination for imports and origin point for exports. The total cost of the port is estimated to be 11- 15 billion USD. Once deep-sea port is built, the neighbouring India, Nepal and Bhutan can make use of this port while it facilitates the domestic economy with faster export and import activities. The port will be fully operational by 2023.</p>

              <p>The Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant will be a 2.4 GW nuclear power plant in Bangladesh. It will be the country’s first nuclear power plant and the commissioning of unit 1 is planned in 2022 while the commissioning of Unit 2 is planned in 2023.The VVER- 1200/523 Nuclear reactor and critical infrastructure are being built by the Russian Rosatom State Atomic Energy Corporation. The project will provide low-cost electricity and create new jobs in Bangladesh. The power production in Bangladesh currently exceeds 4GW a year. The new plant will increase the country’s power production and enable it to achieve energy independence. Karnaphuli Underwater Tunnel Chinese President Xi Jinping and Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina laid the foundation of Karnaphuli Underwater Tunnel worth $2.49 billion in 2016. The boring work beneath the tunnel has been inaugurated by the Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in February 2019. The 3.5km-long four-lane tunnel, the first of its kind in Bangladesh and region, will be built to make the port city of Chittagong “One City Two Towns,” based on a model of East and West Shanghai in China. The construction of the Karnaphuli Tunnel is expected to bolster industrial development, enhance tourism, and expand trade and commerce near the project area, creating employment for thousands of people and boosting exports and there will be a very positive impact on the total economy of the country.</p>

              <h4>Other prospective Mega Projects</h4>
              <p>Dhaka-Chittagong Express Way (rail or road), Circular Road around Dhaka City, Construction of an International Airport in the centre of Bangladesh, Dhaka Underground Train/ Tube Rail and Construction of second bridge on river Padma are a few of the other prospective mega projects that are in the offing in Bangladesh and for which opportunities exist for direct foreign investment. Bangladesh’s development story, especially implementation of the on-going and future mega projects, has earned it the reputation in the region as a hot spot for global investment. The role of these mega infrastructure projects is expected to be fundamental in the overall national development process as they will contribute positively in employment generation, connectivity, regional trade, economic integration as well as energy security of the country. With the completion of the mega-projects the government envisages the economy to grow at a faster pace, which in turn will foster longterm sustainable development.</p>
